# Changelog

All notable changes to dispatcharr-mcp are documented here.

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-25

Tracks Dispatcharr 0.31.0. First release from the [lukeeexd/dispatcharr-mcp](https://github.com/lukeeexd/dispatcharr-mcp) fork; the Docker image is now `ghcr.io/lukeeexd/dispatcharr-mcp`.

### Fixed

- **`bulk_delete_channel_logos` and `bulk_delete_vod_logos` never worked.** Both passed a body to `DispatcharrClient.delete()`, which takes no body, so every call raised `TypeError` before reaching the server. They also sent `ids` where both endpoints read `logo_ids`. Now sent via `delete_with_body` with `logo_ids`. The channel variant gains `delete_files`, which the endpoint has always accepted, to remove local `/data/logos` files as well.
- **`create_subscription` never worked.** It posted `event_type`, but the serializer's fields are `event` and a required `integration`. The signature is now `(event, integration_id, enabled=True, payload_template=None)` and the docstring lists every valid event name. The old signature could not create a subscription, so nothing that worked is broken by the change.
- **JWT mode logged in on every tool call.** `_client()` built a fresh client per call, so the cached token was thrown away each time and the password posted again, despite the comment saying the token was reused. The client is now one instance per process: it logs in once and refreshes on 401.

### Added

- `get_epg_grid` gains the 0.31 window parameters: `days` / `prev_days` (relative to now) or `start` / `end` (ISO 8601, take precedence), plus `channel_profile_id` to scope the grid to one profile. No arguments keeps the previous past-hour-to-next-24h window.
- `list_log_files` and `get_log_file` for the log collector added in 0.31 (admin only). `get_log_file` takes the server's `cursor` to fetch only lines written since the last call, and trims `content` to `max_chars` (default 20 000) on line boundaries — a cursor-less tail can otherwise be up to 24 MB, far past what is useful in a tool result.

### Changed

- **`get_epg_grid` output is filtered and capped.** The raw grid returned every programme on every channel. On a 151-channel install the default 24-hour window was about 1.1 MB, far more than a model can use in one tool result. The tool now:
  - filters by `tvg_ids` and by `search` (title or sub-title)
  - leaves out `description` unless `include_description` is set
  - drops null, false and empty keys from each programme
  - sorts by `start_time` and caps the result at `limit` (default 150)

  The same default call is now about 36 KB. The response is now `{"data": [...], "total", "truncated"}` instead of the raw `{"data": [...]}`, so callers can tell when to narrow the query.
- **Errors now carry Dispatcharr's explanation.** Failed requests still raise `httpx.HTTPStatusError`, but the message now includes method, path and the response body (capped at 500 characters) — e.g. `401 Unauthorized for GET /api/…: {"detail":"Invalid API key"}` instead of a bare status line. Login failures in JWT mode report the same way.
- Docstrings updated for 0.31 behaviour:
  - `rehash_streams` is admin only (403 otherwise).
  - `update_recording` — path fields in `custom_properties` are ignored; recordings stay under `/data/recordings`.
  - `delete_output_profile` — locked profiles are refused; deleting clears user, HDHR and DVR references.
  - `update_setting` — new keys `dvr_settings.output_profile_id`, `proxy_settings.validate_redirect_urls`, and `system_settings.log_persist` / `log_max_mb` / `log_keep`.
  - `update_user` — `custom_properties` merge semantics and the new admin-only `allowed_m3u_profile_ids` (absent = all, `[]` = none, list = only those).
  - `get_system_events` — new `m3u_error` / `epg_error` events.
  - `get_env_settings` — `log_collector_running`.
- README points at the fork, lists the Logs tools, and documents that a set API key never falls back to username/password.
- `dispatcharr_mcp.__version__` was left at 2.5.1 by the last two releases; now matches the package version.

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-29

Tracks Dispatcharr 0.30.0.

### Fixed

- **`bulk_remove_series_rules` never worked.** It posted `{"tvg_ids": [...]}` — a plural list — to an endpoint whose serializer takes a single required `tvg_id` string plus optional `title` and `scope`. Every call returned `400 {"error": "tvg_id or title is required"}`. The schema is identical in every spec copy back to May, so this was wrong from the day the tool was written rather than a break introduced by an upgrade; nothing in 0.30.0 caused it. The signature is now `(tvg_id, title=None, scope="title", epg_source_id=None)`, matching `BulkRemoveSeriesRecordingsRequest`. Callers removing recordings for several channels loop instead of passing a list — the endpoint handles one channel per call.

### Added

Dispatcharr 0.30.0 added three optional fields to existing request bodies. None are required and all are additive, so existing calls keep working unchanged.

- `create_series_rule` and `preview_series_rule` gain `epg_source_id`, which pins a rule to one EPG source. Worth setting whenever a `tvg_id` is carried by more than one source or the channel uses an override EPG: unpinned rules can resolve against the wrong copy of the guide and silently schedule nothing (Dispatcharr #1529). Rules created through the web UI pin a source automatically; rules created through this MCP did not, so they stayed exposed to that bug until now.
- `create_series_rule` and `preview_series_rule` gain `untagged_is_new` for `mode="new"`. By default a programme needs an EPG `<new/>` tag to count as new; this also accepts programmes tagged neither `<new/>` nor `<previously-shown/>`, for guides that only mark repeats. Explicit `<previously-shown/>` stays excluded either way.
- `delete_series_rule` and `bulk_remove_series_rules` gain `epg_source_id`, to disambiguate a `tvg_id` that several sources carry.
- `create_channel_profile` gains `start_empty`. The default still backfills every existing channel; set it to create an empty profile and add channels deliberately.

Pass the same `epg_source_id` and `untagged_is_new` to `preview_series_rule` that you intend to save, or the preview will not reflect what the rule does.

### Changed

- `swagger_new.yaml` refreshed from Dispatcharr 0.30.0 (`/api/schema/`); previous baseline rotated to `swagger_old.yaml`. Note the spec lives at `/api/schema/` — `/api/swagger/` serves the Swagger UI page and 404s for YAML.

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **Image build was broken by an unpinned dependency.** `mcp[cli]>=1.0.0` had no upper bound, and `mcp` 2.0.0 (released 2026-07-28) deleted the `mcp.server.fastmcp` package — FastMCP became `MCPServer` under `mcp.server.mcpserver`, with a different API. Any image built after that date died on startup with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.server.fastmcp'`. The 2.5.0 image was simply the first rebuild since, so it surfaced a landmine that had been armed for two weeks. Now pinned to `mcp[cli]>=1.0.0,<2`.

Porting to the 2.x `MCPServer` API remains outstanding; the pin is what makes that a scheduled job rather than an outage.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-10

Tracks Dispatcharr 0.29.0.

### Fixed

- `delete_series_rule` — the `DELETE /api/channels/series-rules/{tvg_id}/` route no longer exists; the rule is now deleted via query parameters on the collection (`DELETE /api/channels/series-rules/?tvg_id=...`). The old path did not fail cleanly: Dispatcharr's SPA catch-all answered it with `200 text/html`, so `raise_for_status()` passed and the tool then died parsing HTML as JSON.

### Added

- `delete_series_rule` gains an optional `title` argument, to delete one rule when several exist on the same channel. `create_series_rule` has always accepted `title`, but the old path-based delete had no way to target those rules.
- `list_movies` gains an optional `is_adult` filter — `False` excludes adult titles, `True` lists only those, omitted returns everything. New query parameter in 0.29.0.
- `DispatcharrClient.delete()` accepts `params`, so query-parameter deletes are expressible.

### Changed

- `swagger_new.yaml` refreshed from Dispatcharr 0.29.0 (`/api/schema/`); previous baseline rotated to `swagger_old.yaml`.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-24

Adds full catch-up/timeshift support matching Dispatcharr 0.28.x.

### Added

- `create_catchup_session` — create a catch-up playback session for an archived programme; returns a `playback_url` valid for 60 seconds with a 10-minute sliding idle window
- `delete_catchup_session` — revoke a catch-up session before it expires
- `update_catchup_session_position` — report playhead position and pause state to keep admin stats accurate
- `get_catchup_stats` — list all active catch-up viewer sessions (stats page data)
- `stop_catchup_client` — terminate an active catch-up client session
- `get_all_proxy_stats` — single call returning combined live, VOD, and catch-up stats (`/proxy/stats/`)

### Removed

- `change_hls_stream` — the `/proxy/hls/change_stream/` endpoint was removed in Dispatcharr 0.28. Use `change_channel_stream` (TS proxy) instead.

---

## [2.3.4] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- `FastMCP` constructor ignores env vars — explicitly pass `host` and `port` from `FASTMCP_HOST` / `FASTMCP_PORT` / `PORT` env vars so the HTTP server binds correctly in Docker and Kubernetes

---

## [2.3.3] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Corrected env var from `MCP_HOST` to `FASTMCP_HOST` (FastMCP uses `FASTMCP_` prefix for all settings)

---

## [2.3.2] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Set `MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` as default in Docker image so the HTTP server binds to all interfaces (not just loopback), enabling Kubernetes and remote container deployments to connect
- Updated README Docker `run` example to include `MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0`

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- Docker image now runs in **streamable-http** mode by default (port 8000), allowing clients to connect over HTTP rather than requiring stdio process spawning
- `MCP_TRANSPORT` env var controls transport — defaults to `streamable-http` in Docker; set to `stdio` for local venv usage
- Updated README Docker section to reflect persistent container usage and `mcp.json` HTTP configuration
- Fixed GitHub username in README clone URL

---
